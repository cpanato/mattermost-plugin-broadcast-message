# Broadcast messages

If you need to send a message to all users in a Mattermost Team to notify those users for something very important you can use this plugin.
It will send a DM message with your message to all users, and if the email notification is enabled the users will get the email as well.

Use cases:

- Notify the user when will have some maintanance in the Mattermost instance.
- Communicate an important message to all users.


## Development

To avoid having to manually install your plugin, build and deploy your plugin using one of the following options.

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. Edit your server configuration as follows:

```json
{
    "ServiceSettings": {
        ...
        "EnableLocalMode": true,
        "LocalModeSocketLocation": "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket"
    }
}
```

and then deploy your plugin:
```
make deploy
```

You may also customize the Unix socket path:
```
export MM_LOCALSOCKETPATH=/var/tmp/alternate_local.socket
make deploy
```

If developing a plugin with a webapp, watch for changes and deploy those automatically:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make watch
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with credentials:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```
